# ArduinoSongs
This is a repository that I keep for generating songs with an arduino nano every board or other boards. 

The whole idea is a replication of MaxImagination: https://www.youtube.com/@MaxImagination

The songs found here can be copy pasted and used in a variety of ways.

Good place to transcribe music by ear: https://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/
