# ArduinoSongs
This is a repository that I keep for generating songs with an arduino nano every board. 

The whole idea is a replication of MaxImagination: https://www.youtube.com/@MaxImagination

Some songs that can be found here so far: 

- happy birthday
- here comes the bride

In addition to the melody, I have encorporated some selection of which buzzer or LED to turn on for specific notes in the song. For example:

- all LEDs and all buzzers are used for long notes.
- For rare notes in the song, a randomized selection is called

At some point I will add more songs, hope someone else finds this useful
